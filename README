This modules provides functions to create classes with the intention of
mimicking another module or classes API and then invoking a dispatch
function to implement some desired, alternate behaviour.

The functionality of this module is split into parts: factories and
converters. For the purposes of this module, an API is considered just
to be a dictionary of name, function key, value pairs.

A factory takes an API and produces a class that can be initialized
with the desired dispatch function.  Two factories are supplied:

`api_mimic.full_mimic_factory` produces a class whose methods'
signatures exactly match the mimicked API.

`api_mimic.shallow_mimic_factory` produces a class whose methods'
signatures match a provide signature.

Converters are intended to take an object and produce an API that can
be then consumed by factories.

One converter is currently implemented:

`api_mimic.load_module` creates an API from a module.
